# Colleges & hotels: house people now to help end this crisis.
Not everyone can self-isolate. People live with older relatives, spouses & roommates. Sending sick people home to infect others is wrong: it amplifies inequality, spreads the virus, and delays our return to normal life. We must offer everyone a safe place to isolate; repurposed dormitories and empty hotel rooms are the key.

## What's happening?

The places that slowed the spread of Covid-19 made two efforts the United States is not making: testing everyone and offering quarantine centers. In [Wuhan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0y5YUFak2xVamIVPTDaBhE76q2MAwRr/view), [Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/quarantine-places-including-chalets-being-prepared-as-singapore-fights-spread-of), [Hong Kong](https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/quarantine_centre_en.pdf), [South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html%20https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html), they didnâ€™t just tell people to self-quarantine in their own houses; they provided places [for at-risk people to live temporarily](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-30/italy-home-quarantine-repeats-mistake-made-in-china-doctors-say).                 

Clearly, we need more testing. But to flatten the curve and save lives, we need to ensure that those who are sick or work in high-risk jobs, and can't afford to self-isolate have places to quarantine. [Experts](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.20.0080), [reports](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/), [data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1), and [more](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30162-6/fulltext#seccestitle80) show that by offering a place for just 1 person to quarantine, we can save hundreds of lives. 

Chinese authorities have now say they erred in telling people who are sick to quarantine at home, as data has shown that most of the transmission of covid-19 is happening in the house where more than 1 person lives. 

This disease will likely hit our low-income community, essential workers, and homeless the hardest. About 20% of people live in multi-generational homes. And, low-income often must live with at least one other person. Minorities and African Americans in particular have high incidences of heart disease and other pre-existing conditions. Given this perfect storm of deadly factors for this part of the population, it is simply immoral to not offer spaces that are available for self-quarantining.


## Where do these beds & rooms come from?

Right now, colleges and universities have sent their students home and their dormitories lay dormant. Hotels are experiencing an incredibly low volume, so low that hotels are illuminating their empty rooms into the shapes of hearts to thank healthcare workers. That's a good gesture, but it's time to actually take a load off of our medical system by offering those empty room to anyone who needs them. 
Some schools and hotels have already stepped up to do this. In Italy, people are moving into 3000 rooms being made available by 15 hotels as we speak. They're leading the way so that others may join them before it's too late. 

Some of those beds may come from requisitioned hotels. And many of those beds should come from universities and colleges across the country proactively offering space for frontline workers and people in non-critical conditions to shelter separately from non-infected people.

## What to ask fellow alumni

Send this appeal to fellow classmates via email, group chats, or alumni mailing lists:

*There's a new campaign to get colleges and universities to open up their dorms and facilities to health care workers and vulnerable populations to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of COVID-19. I really think we should try to get our alma mater to do this. Can you join me in contacting them? If you'd like to sign on to a letter I can send it. There's more info about the campaign here: HousePeopleNow.com*
